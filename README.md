# Emotion-Detection
Investigating the use of Convolutional Neural Networks in Emotion Detection.

The goal of my project is to compare different approaches for emotion detection. For the first method I wish to investigate the use of different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. The models I will be looking into are the VGGNet, Inception and EfficientNet.

I want to look into these models are the fact that they excel at specifically classifying images in their own ways.

The plan is to first see if the models I have chosen are compatible with the dataset by running them once and seeing if they produce sufficient results (i.e. not chaotic). I will then use cross validation to train and test the models. K-folds cross validation would seem to be the best method for this stage.

Lastly, I will use a set of real pictures seperate from the data set, to test the performance of the models on "real-world" data and analyse the results.

The specifics for analysis are not yet fully set.

K-folds = 

Maximum time for training = 1 hours
