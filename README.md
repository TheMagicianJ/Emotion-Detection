# Emotion-Detection
Investigating the use of Convolutional Neural Networks in Emotion Detection.

The goal of my project is to compare different approaches for emotion detection. For the first method I wish to investigate the use of different Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) models. The models I will be looking into are VGGNet, Inception and EfficientNet.

I want to look into these models for the fact that they excel at specifically classifying images in their own ways.

The plan is to first see if the models I have chosen are compatible with the dataset by running them once and seeing if they produce sufficient results (i.e. not chaotic). I will then use cross validation to train and test the models. K-folds cross validation would seem to be the best method for this stage.


The specifics for analysis are not yet fully set.
